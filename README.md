# DevFest Brussels 2015 - Design library demo

This application has been developed as an example for the presentation made for the Brussels' DevFest 2015 presentation.

This application was not developed with the intention to be published on the Play Store and a lot of error cases were not thought through.
Also, a lot of performance enhancements can still be made as well.
